# Self Evaluation

- **How might the `each` method be useful?** This could be helpful if there are multiple changes needed for multiple elements in an array
 
- **What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that?** I'm still learning how to bring new methods into arrays - I really struggled with the finding the square practice problem I just got into a rabbit hole of google searches. I will revisit the practice problems with a fresh mind after a break and will go back to the Ruby-doc to see if I'm missing something! 
- **What worked well for you in terms of your approach on this
assignment?** I was able to take a step back into what we really do know. Even though I was live coding on this, I was able to pull in the context from the lesson and think through it as I was going.
